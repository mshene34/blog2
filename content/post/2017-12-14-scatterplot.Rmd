Hello all! Let's make a scatterplot to look at career homeruns and strikeouts from players who had more than 400 homeruns. First, install the following packages in R-Studio.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)
```

After the packages are installed, it is time to extract the data with an sql request.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS CareerHR,sum(SO) AS CareerSO
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>400"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

After the data is extracted, it is time to visualize the data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot()+
geom_point(data=result,aes(x=CareerSO,y=CareerHR),size=3)+
ggtitle("Career Strikeouts and Homeruns - The Best")+
xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
ylab("Career Homeruns")
```

There you have it, a nice polished scatterplot!
