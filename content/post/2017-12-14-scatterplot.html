<p>Hello all! Letâ€™s make a scatterplot to look at career homeruns and strikeouts from players who had more than 400 homeruns. First, install the following packages in R-Studio.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>After the packages are installed, it is time to extract the data with an sql request.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS CareerHR,sum(SO) AS CareerSO
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)&gt;400&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>After the data is extracted, it is time to visualize the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
geom_point(data=result,aes(x=CareerSO,y=CareerHR),size=3)+
ggtitle(&quot;Career Strikeouts and Homeruns - The Best&quot;)+
xlab(&quot;Career Strikeouts&quot;)+
ylab(&quot;Career Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>There you have it, a nice polished scatterplot!</p>
