Hello all! Let's make a time series plot by looking at Babe Ruthâ€™s homeruns over his twenty-two seasons. First, install the following packages in R-Studio.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)
```

After the packages are installed, it is time to extract the data with an sql request.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

After the data is extracted, it is time to visualize the data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),color="black")+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Homerun Totals Through the Years")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Homeruns")
```

There you have it! Babe Ruth's homeruns over the years by a time series!
